- A Java IDE or text editor for writing and running the code.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Luxxgit2k4/atm-simulation.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Atm-simulation-program
```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Usage
